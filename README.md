# Shoot-The-Ball Range - A Front-End Clone of SidcupFamilyGolf

This is a Website I made using HTML5, CSS, and Javascript as a testament of my Front-End skills. I've used a popular Javascript Libraries called GSAP by Greensock for some amazing animations. I've also used tilt.js and swiper.js for tilt-effect on cards and automatic carousels respectively. The layout of the website is a clone of SidCupFamilyGolf.com. The idea behind it was to test and improve my coding skills by building a realistic projects for an actual business.
