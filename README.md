# Shoot-The-Ball Range - A Front-End Clone of SidcupFamilyGolf

This website showcases my front-end skills, developed using HTML5, CSS, and Javascript. I've utilized GSAP, a popular JavaScript library by Greensock, for captivating animations. Additionally, tilt.js and swiper.js were employed for tilt effects on cards and automatic carousels, respectively. The website layout is inspired by SidCupFamilyGolf.com. The project aimed to enhance my coding abilities by creating a realistic project for a genuine business.
